My research focuses on the long-term effects of adverse childhood experiences and their associations with adult psychopathology. During my clinical internship at a forensic psychiatry center, I gained exposure to assessment and intervention processes. I also serve as a peer reviewer for international psychology journals. My current interests lie in cognitive-behavioral mechanisms underlying common adult disorders such as anxiety, depression, and trauma-related conditions.","location":{"address":"","postalCode":"","city":"Ho Chi Minh City","countryCode":"VN","region":"Vietnam"},"profiles":[{"network":"LinkedIn","username":"vy-truc-le-a10155276","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vy-truc-le-a10155276/"},{"network":"Google Scholar","username":"pnxR0u0AAAAJ","url":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pnxR0u0AAAAJ&hl=vi"},{"network":"ORCID","username":"0009-0002-1008-2380","url":"https://orcid.org/0009-0002-1008-2380"},{"network":"ResearchGate","username":"Vy-Le-121","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vy-Le-121?ev=hdr_xprf"}]},"education":[{"institution":"Ho Chi Minh University of Education","location":"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","url":"https://hcmue.edu.vn","area":"Psychology","studyType":"Bachelor","startDate":"2020-08","endDate":"2024-06","score":"9.0/10.0","courses":["Thesis: Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Among Students with Adverse Childhood Experiences in Ho Chi Minh City","Advisor: MSc.
