I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology from Ho Chi Minh University of Education, Vietnam. During my undergraduatestudies, I worked as a Research Assistant in the university’s laboratory under the supervision of Ph.D. Vinh-Long Tran-Chi, where I gained hands-on experience in psychological research. 

 My research focuses on the long-term effects of adverse childhood experiences and their associations with adult psychopathology. During my clinical internship at a forensic psychiatry center, I gained exposure to assessment and intervention processes. I also serve as a peer reviewer for international psychology journals. My current interests lie in cognitive-behavioral mechanisms underlying common adult disorders such as anxiety, depression, and trauma-related conditions.
