I am a psychology graduate with experience in both research and clinical settings. My research focuses on the long-term effects of adverse childhood experiences and their associations with adult psychopathology. During my clinical internship at a forensic psychiatry center, I gained exposure to assessment and intervention processes. I also serve as a peer reviewer for international psychology journals. My current interests lie in cognitive-behavioral mechanisms underlying common adult disorders such as anxiety, depression, and trauma-related conditions.
