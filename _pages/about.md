I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology from <span style="color:#004080; font-weight:bold;">Ho Chi Minh University of Education</span>, Vietnam. During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a Research Assistant in the university’s laboratory under the supervision of <span style="color:#008080; font-weight:bold;">Dr. Vinh-Long Tran-Chi</span>, where I gained hands-on experience in psychological research.

My research primarily explores the long-term effects of adverse childhood experiences and their associations with adult psychopathology. Through my clinical internship at a forensic psychiatry center, I obtained valuable exposure to psychological assessment and intervention practices. In addition, I currently serve as a peer reviewer for international psychology journals. My academic interests center on cognitive-behavioral mechanisms underlying common adult disorders, including anxiety, depression, and trauma-related conditions.
