I am a psychology graduate with experience in both research and clinical settings. My research focuses on the long-term effects of adverse childhood experiences and their associations with adult psychopathology. During my clinical internship at a forensic psychiatry center, I gained exposure to assessment and intervention processes. I also serve as a peer reviewer for international psychology journals. My current interests lie in cognitive-behavioral mechanisms underlying common adult disorders such as anxiety, depression, and trauma-related conditions.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
